# Pokémon Game
## A simple Pokémon battle simulator game
While learning C# in high school, I decided to take what I learned (which was admittedly pretty basic at the time) and make something interesting out of it. I've always been a pretty huge fan of the Pokémon games, so I decided to try and see if I could make a simple battle/catching simulator between two Pokémon.

## Objective
The goal of this game can be anything you want! You can choose to simply battle the opposing Pokémon and see who wins or decide to catch the Pokémon; you make your own rules. Maybe if you're really lucky, you'll come across an even rarer version of the opposing Pokémon...who knows?

## Download and Play
**NOTE**: This program can only be run on the Windows operating system.

In order to play this game, please visit [this link](http://tylerhendrickson.me/downloads/PokemonGame.exe) to download an executable that can be run on your local machine. Rest assured, this is just a simple Windows form app and will not harm your computer in any way.

## How to Play
This game was built as a basic Windows form app, so all of your options will be represented as buttons in the window. The buttons operate as follows:

* **"A" button** - Advances the dialog so that the next event can take place
* **"Restart" button** - Restarts the game
* **Any other button** - Selects the attack or item to be used during your turn (this must be followed up with the A button)

In order for the game to run smoothly, please remember to **continually press the A button until it disappears**. This will ensure that the dialog advances correctly. 
*(Yeah, I know, not exactly user friendly. Cut me some slack, I was in high school.)*
